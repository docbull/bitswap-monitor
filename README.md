**Download the latest release**

- Mac - [ipfs-monitor](https://github.com/Sab94/ipfs-monitor/releases/download/v0.1.1/ipfsmon_darwin_amd64_0.1.1)
- Windows - [ipfs-monitor.exe](https://github.com/Sab94/ipfs-monitor/releases/download/v0.1.1/ipfsmon_windows_amd64_0.1.1.exe)
- Linux - [ipfs-monitor](https://github.com/Sab94/ipfs-monitor/releases/download/v0.1.1/ipfsmon_linux_amd64_0.1.1)

#### Download and Compile

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Sab94/ipfs-monitor.git

$ cd ipfs-monitor
$ make install
```

Alternatively, you can run `make build` to build the ipfsmon binary (storing it in `cmd/`) without installing it.

##### Cross Compiling

Compiling for a different platform is as simple as running:

```
make build GOOS=TargetOS GOARCH=TargetArchitecture
```

#### Running

```
ipfsmon

or

ipfsmon http://localhost:5001
```

It connects to default ipfs api `http://localhost:5001`, if you are running ipfs on a different port
pass the api url as first argument

- [ ] add more modules (swarm-addrs, bitswap-ledger, etc...)
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] add a guide for adding more modules
